### Statechart and Activity Modeling for the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker**

Let's apply **Statechart and Activity Modeling** concepts to the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker**. Below, we'll go over how to represent the system's behavior and flow of control using statechart diagrams and activity diagrams, identifying the distinct states, events causing transitions, and the basic activities involved.

### **Statechart Diagram for the Face Recognition Attendance Tracker**

#### 1. **Identifying Distinct States**
We first identify the distinct states the system passes through during its operation. These states will be represented in the statechart diagram.

Here are some potential states for the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker**:

- **Idle**: The system is waiting for a user to start the process.
- **Capturing Image**: The camera is capturing a face image for recognition.
- **Recognizing Face**: The system processes the captured image to recognize a face.
- **Face Recognized**: The system successfully recognizes the user’s face.
- **Logging Attendance**: The system logs the attendance after recognizing the face.
- **Face Not Recognized**: The system fails to recognize the user’s face.
- **Error**: There is an issue, like a failed system or hardware malfunction.
- **Shutdown**: The system is turned off or in idle mode after completing its task.

#### 2. **Events Causing Transitions**
Next, we identify the events that trigger transitions from one state to another.

- **Event: Start Button Pressed** → Causes the system to move from **Idle** to **Capturing Image**.
- **Event: Image Captured** → Triggers the transition from **Capturing Image** to **Recognizing Face**.
- **Event: Face Recognized** → Moves the system from **Recognizing Face** to **Face Recognized** and then to **Logging Attendance**.
- **Event: Face Not Recognized** → Transitions from **Recognizing Face** to **Face Not Recognized**.
- **Event: Attendance Logged** → Moves from **Logging Attendance** to **Idle** or **Shutdown**.
- **Event: Error Occurred** → Causes a transition from any state to **Error**.
- **Event: Power Off** → Transitions from **Idle** or **Error** to **Shutdown**.

#### 3. **Building the Statechart Diagram**
Here’s how the **Statechart Diagram** for the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker** might look:

```
[Initial] --> Idle
Idle --> Capturing Image : Start Button Pressed
Capturing Image --> Recognizing Face : Image Captured
Recognizing Face --> Face Recognized : Face Recognized
Recognizing Face --> Face Not Recognized : Face Not Recognized
Face Recognized --> Logging Attendance : Attendance Logged
Logging Attendance --> Idle : Attendance Logged
Face Not Recognized --> Idle : Retry
Error --> Idle : Power Off / Restart
Idle --> Shutdown : Power Off
Shutdown --> [Final]
```

In this diagram:
- **Idle** is the starting point.
- **Shutdown** is the final state.
- Transitions between states are triggered by specific events.

### **Activity Diagram for the Face Recognition Attendance Tracker**

#### 1. **Identifying Activities**
The **activities** represent the work performed in the system. The primary activities in this case would include:

- **Start Attendance Process**: The process begins when the user activates the system.
- **Capture Image**: The system uses the camera to capture the face image.
- **Recognize Face**: The system attempts to match the captured face with the database.
- **Log Attendance**: After recognizing the face, attendance is logged in the system.
- **Retry Face Recognition**: If the face is not recognized, the system prompts the user to retry.
- **Handle Error**: If an error occurs (e.g., camera failure), the system handles it appropriately.

#### 2. **Defining Control Flow**
The flow of control for the attendance tracking process is as follows:

1. **Initial Node**: The process starts when the user presses the start button.
2. **Capture Image**: The camera captures the face image.
3. **Decision Node**: After the image is captured, the system decides if the face is recognized.
   - **If Face Recognized**: Proceed to **Log Attendance**.
   - **If Face Not Recognized**: Prompt user to **Retry Face Recognition**.
4. **Log Attendance**: If the face is recognized, attendance is logged.
5. **Final Node**: After logging attendance, the process either ends or returns to **Idle**.

#### 3. **Building the Activity Diagram**
Here’s how the **Activity Diagram** for the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker** might look:

```
[Initial] --> Start Attendance Process
Start Attendance Process --> Capture Image
Capture Image --> Recognize Face
Recognize Face --> [Decision] : Is face recognized?
  - Yes --> Log Attendance --> [Final]
  - No  --> Retry Face Recognition --> Recognize Face
```

- **Start Attendance Process** is the first activity.
- **Capture Image** follows when the system captures the face.
- **Recognize Face** then checks whether the face is recognized.
- **Log Attendance** occurs if recognition is successful.
- If not, the system allows retrying the face recognition.

### **Key Components of Activity Diagram**:
- **Initial Node**: The start of the process.
- **Final Node**: Marks the completion of the process (e.g., logging attendance or retrying).
- **Decision Node**: Decides whether the face was recognized or not.
- **Guard Conditions**: The condition that must be true for a transition to occur, such as "Face Recognized".

### **Conclusion**
- **Statechart Diagram**: Helps in modeling the various states the **Face Recognition Attendance Tracker** system will go through, and the events that cause transitions between these states.
- **Activity Diagram**: Represents the flow of activities involved in the system’s functioning, helping to visualize the sequence of tasks and decision points.

Both diagrams are crucial in **Object-Oriented Design** to understand the dynamic behavior and control flow of the system, ensuring a clear and structured design.
